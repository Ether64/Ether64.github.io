A few months ago, I seized the opportunity to participate in CompTIA's beta exam offering for the CySA+. Fast forward to last week- I received news of my successful completion of the exam! Even though I am in the early stages of my certification journey, this accomplishment felt like a hard fought-win that challenged my mastery of concepts related to incident response, GRC, and threat hunting. In any case, I am now officially recognized as a Computer Security Analytics Professional (CSAP) according to CompTIA's standards. Congratulations to all other individuals who passed the exam. Onto the next!
